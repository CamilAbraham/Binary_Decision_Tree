# Binary Decision Tree
Simple implementation of a decision tree.

The reason why the name "Binary" is added is because this tree only accepts binary input features. The target or output of the tree doesn't need to be binary, it can have a wide range of values.

This decision tree uses gini impurity to decide the parent node.








To do:
[ ] Remove the binary feature. The node division will now be decided by a calculated threshold. This is so that the input features can be more than just 1 or 0.
[ ] Add different methods for parent node selection like entropy.
